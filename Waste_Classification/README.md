# Waste Classification


## Problem Statement

In Pakistan, waste management presents a significant challenge, with millions of tons of waste being generated annually. Unfortunately, a considerable portion of this waste finds its way into landfills, worsening health hazards for both humans and animals.

Landfills can cause pollution that leads to various diseases. 

These diseases include:

* Respiratory and digestive diseases

**With the advancement of technology, it is our sole responsibility to make efforts to save our environment. We have to establish efficient waste management systems and educate people to begin managing waste at home. By implementing strong and efficient municipal systems, we can reduce the amount of waste ending up in landfills, and if done correctly, we can increase recycling rates. Additionally, organic waste management is important and beneficial for the environment. Organic waste can be utilized for composting or as a resource for heat, electricity, and fuel through methods such as incineration or anaerobic digestion.**
